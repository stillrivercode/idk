- **Content:** Core (SELECT, CREATE, DELETE, FIX), Development (analyze this, debug this, optimize this), Documentation (document this, explain this, research this), QA (test this, review this), Workflow (plan this, spec this), Git (commit, push, pr, gh, comment)

---

## Phase 1: Community Growth (Current Focus)

**Timeline:** Next 6 months
**Goal:** Expand dictionary based on community usage patterns and improve documentation

### Immediate Tasks

✅ **Add "spec this" command** (Issue #11) - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Define formal specification creation command
- ✅ Include clear usage examples and expected outputs
- ✅ Create `/specs` directory with documentation

✅ **Modular Dictionary Architecture** - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ Restructured to modular architecture with `dictionary/` subdirectories
- ✅ Converted main file to index with links to detailed command definitions
- ✅ Development commands: analyze this, debug this, optimize this
- ✅ Documentation commands: document this, explain this, research this
- ✅ Quality Assurance commands: test this, review this
- ✅ Workflow commands: plan this, spec this
- ✅ Git commands: commit, push, pr, gh, comment
- ✅ Core commands: SELECT, CREATE, DELETE, FIX
- ✅ Expected Output Formats for all commands
- ✅ Command chaining documentation and examples

- [ ] **Continue Community-Driven Expansion:**
  - Add UI/UX commands when community requests (e.g., "UserForm", "Dashboard")
  - Add data manipulation commands based on usage patterns
  - Add API/integration commands as needed
  - Target: 100+ community-contributed commands over time

### Community Building

- [ ] **Documentation Improvements:**
  - Create interactive examples
  - Add video tutorials
  - Build searchable command reference

- [ ] **Community Engagement:**
  - Monthly virtual meetups
  - Developer advocacy at conferences
  - Active blog with use cases
  - Target: 1000+ GitHub stars

### Optional Tooling (If Community Requests)

- [ ] **VS Code Extension:**
  - Simple autocomplete for commands
  - Inline command expansion
  - Only if strong community demand

- [ ] **Lightweight CLI Tool:**
  - Command lookup and expansion
  - Integration with shells
  - Only if usage patterns justify it

---

## Phase 2: Sustainable Growth (6+ months)

**Goal:** Scale based on proven community demand, maintaining simplicity as core principle

### Potential Features (Community-Driven)

- [ ] **Browser Extensions:**
  - Chrome/Firefox extensions for web-based AI tools
  - Quick command reference and insertion
  - Only if web usage patterns emerge

- [ ] **Enterprise Features:**
  - Team-specific command namespaces
  - Usage analytics dashboards
  - Compliance reporting tools
  - Only if enterprise adoption occurs

- [ ] **API Layer:**
  - REST API for programmatic access
  - Integration with LangChain and similar frameworks
  - Only if integration demand is clear

- [ ] **Multi-language Support:**
  - Translations of core commands
  - Language-specific command variations
  - Regional community chapters

### Revenue Model (If Needed)

**Core Principle:** Dictionary always free and open source

**Optional Services:**

- Training workshops and certification
- Enterprise support contracts
- Custom namespace hosting
- Team onboarding assistance

---

## Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators (0-6 months)

- **Community Growth**: GitHub stars, forks, and contributors
- **Content Quality**: Command count and validation pass rate
- **Engagement**: Issue discussions and PR submissions

### Lagging Indicators (6-24 months)

- **Adoption**: Projects actively using the dictionary
- **Usage Patterns**: Most frequently used commands
- **Success Stories**: Documented productivity improvements

---

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Resist complexity until community clearly demands it
2. **Community-Driven**: Every decision based on actual user needs
3. **Open Forever**: Core dictionary always free and accessible
4. **Quality Focus**: Better to have fewer well-defined commands than many vague ones

---

## Long-term Vision

Establish the Information Dense Keywords Dictionary as the de facto standard for human-AI
collaboration in software development. Success means developers naturally reach for these
commands when working with any AI assistant, creating a shared vocabulary that improves
productivity and consistency across the industry.

**Positioning:**

- "Human-readable, not machine-compressed"
- "Community standards, not proprietary prompts"
- "Simple files, not complex frameworks"
