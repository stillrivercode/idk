## Overview

### Problem Statement

This specification outlines the technical details for implementing the foundational components of the project, as defined in Phase 1 of the roadmap. This includes the creation of 20 core IDKs and their corresponding simple YAML definitions.

### Solution Summary

The proposed solution involves creating a directory structure to house the 20 core IDKs and their corresponding YAML definitions. A validation script will be created to ensure the integrity of the YAML files.

### Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To establish the core infrastructure for the IDK project.
- **Secondary Goals**: To create a set of 20 core IDKs that can be used as a foundation for future development.
- **Success Criteria**: The successful creation and validation of the 20 core IDKs and their YAML definitions.

### Assumptions and Constraints

- **Assumptions**: The 20 core IDKs will be sufficient for the MVP.
- **Constraints**: The YAML definitions must be simple and easy to understand.
- **Dependencies**: None.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of a directory of YAML files, each representing an IDK. A validation script will be used to ensure the integrity of the YAML files.

### Component Overview

| Component | Responsibility   | Technology   |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| IDK YAML files  | Define the IDKs   | YAML |
| Validation script   | Validate the IDK YAML files   | Bash/Python |

### Data Flow

1. A user creates or modifies an IDK YAML file.
2. The user runs the validation script to ensure the integrity of the YAML file.
3. The validation script returns a success or failure message.

## Detailed Design

### Core Components

#### Component 1: IDK YAML files

**Purpose**: To define the IDKs.

**Responsibilities**:

- Each YAML file will represent a single IDK.
- Each YAML file will contain a set of key-value pairs that define the IDK.

**Interfaces**:

- None.

#### Component 2: Validation script

**Purpose**: To validate the IDK YAML files.

**Responsibilities**:

- The validation script will check for the presence of required keys in the YAML files.
- The validation script will check for the correct data types of the values in the YAML files.

### Algorithms and Logic

#### Algorithm 1: Validation script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Basic validation script for IDK YAML files
for file in idks/*.yaml; do
  if ! grep -q "name:" "$file"; then
    echo "Error: $file is missing the 'name' key."
    exit 1
  fi
done
echo "All IDK YAML files are valid."
```

### Error Handling

- **Error Type 1**: Missing required key. The validation script will return an error message and exit.
- **Error Type 2**: Incorrect data type. The validation script will return an error message and exit.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Framework**: A simple shell script will be used for unit testing the validation script.
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+
- **Test Categories**: Business logic, data access, utilities.

### Integration Testing

N/A for this phase.

### End-to-End Testing

## Deployment Plan

### Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy Type**: The IDK YAML files will be deployed as part of the git repository.
- **Rollback Plan**: A git revert will be used to roll back any changes.
- **Health Checks**: The validation script will be used as a health check.

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose                | Configuration    |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Development | Development work       | Local machine |
| Staging     | Pre-production testing | N/A |
| Production  | Live system            | GitHub repository |

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Compute**: A local machine for development.
- **Storage**: A GitHub repository for storage.
- **Network**: An internet connection.
