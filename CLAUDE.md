- **Documentation**: Leverage your writing capabilities to improve command definitions and documentation
- **Analysis**: Apply your reasoning skills to identify gaps in the dictionary and suggest improvements
- **Integration**: Use your knowledge of development workflows to ensure commands align with real-world practices
