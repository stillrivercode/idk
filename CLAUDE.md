# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with AI-powered development workflows in your repository.

## Overview

This project is a dictionary of commands that an AI assistant can be trained to understand. The goal is to create a shared, efficient vocabulary for common software development tasks.

## How to Use This Dictionary

As an AI assistant, you should use the `idk-dictionary.md` file as your primary source of truth for understanding the user's intent. When a user issues a command, you should first try to match it to one of the keywords in the dictionary.

### Usage Pattern

1.  **Identify the Keyword**: Parse the user's prompt to identify the core command (e.g., `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `FIX`).

2.  **Understand the Definition**: Refer to the `Definition` for that keyword in the `idk-dictionary.md` to understand the user's high-level goal.

3.  **Extract Entities**: Identify the specific entities in the user's prompt. For example, in the prompt `CREATE a new React component called 'LoginButton'`, the entities are:
    *   **Component Type**: React component
    *   **Component Name**: LoginButton

4.  **Execute the Command**: Based on the keyword and the extracted entities, perform the requested action. This may involve:
    *   Searching for files in the codebase.
    *   Generating new code.
    *   Modifying existing code.
    *   Running shell commands.

## AI Development Workflow

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Workflow Guide**: See [docs/ai-workflow-guide.md](docs/ai-workflow-guide.md) for the full structured approach to AI development workflows.

### Recommended Workflow

1.  **Start with Research**: Use `analyze-issue` to understand the problem space
2.  **Update Roadmap**: Use `roadmap` to plan your features
3.  **Create Specifications**: Use `create-spec-issue` for detailed technical specs
4.  **Implement with AI**: Create implementation issues with the `ai-task` label

### Common Commands

- `analyze-issue` - Research & analysis (Step 1)
- `roadmap` - Plan features (Step 2)
- `create-spec-issue` - Create technical specs (Step 3)

### Example Usage

```bash
# Step 1: Research & Analysis
analyze-issue --issue 123
analyze-issue --issue 123 --generate-docs  # Creates research docs

# Step 2: Plan Features
roadmap --generate --input "New Feature A, Refactor B"
roadmap --generate --research-doc research.md  # Use research docs

# Step 3: Create Technical Specs
create-spec-issue --title "Technical specification for user login"
```

- Standard git operations and file management

## Workflow Context

When working locally, you help developers with:

- Code generation and review
- Test creation
- Documentation
- Bug fixing

Remember: GitHub Actions use OpenRouter, not local CLI tools.
